# [POC] Flutter + Atomic State Management

It's a proof of concept (POC) of Atomic State Management on Flutter.

## Why Atom?
After a long discussion on the Flutter Brazilian community ([Flutterando](https://flutterando.com.br/)), we noticed the biggest difficulty in State Management on Flutter is state delivery related, not reactivity.

So the idea of trying to implement this state management pattern is to improve the delivery system of the reactive state.
